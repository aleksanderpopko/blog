*Here is a summary of the best news and articles I've read during
April 2018. The criteria are very simple - the selection is 100%
subjective.*

### üì± Smartphones

Smartphones are useful, but can also be very addictive. [Making your smartphone dumber](https://nomasters.io/posts/dumber-phone/) should reduce external stimulus and distraction.

[BLLOC](https://www.blloc.com/) - minimalistic, simple smartphone with cool design.

[iOS app development, seen through the eyes of an Android developer.](https://android.jlelse.eu/one-night-stand-with-ios-in-depth-comparison-from-android-developers-perspective-87ac82589195) Some interesting insights into the differences and similarities between these two platforms.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Swift

[How to name IBActions?](http://blog.cocoafrog.de/2018/04/12/How-to-name-IBActions.html) Popular `didTapButton` or `buttonTapped` is inherently wrong. Target-action is a command pattern, not a delegate pattern.

[Behind-the scenes improvements in Swift 4.1.](https://medium.com/@slavapestov/behind-the-scenes-improvements-in-swift-4-1-269dd56e30c2) Author focused on smaller, less visible improvements , which are still interesting.

[What‚Äôs new in Swift?](https://www.whatsnewinswift.com/) Great tool to compare different versions of the language.

### ‚Çø Bitcoin

[Is Bitcoin the greatest scam in history?](https://www.recode.net/2018/4/24/17275202/bitcoin-scam-cryptocurrency-mining-pump-dump-fraud-ico-value) Strong arguments against cryptocurrency. I would like this article even more if it wasn‚Äôt written by PayPal‚Äôs CEO.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Blogging

[Why every developer should have a blog.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf) Reasons why it is worth it to keep a technical blog and how to do it.

### üëî Recruitment

[Unpaid, time-consuming homework is a new trend in the tech-recruitment industry.](https://work.qz.com/1254663/job-interviews-for-programmers-now-often-come-with-days-of-unpaid-homework/) The only reasonable answer to such a phenomena is ‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù

[Job-hunting for a satisfying senior engineering role is not as easy as it might look.](
http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html) Some stats:

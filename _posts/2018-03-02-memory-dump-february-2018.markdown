*Here is a summary of the best news and articles I've read during
February 2018\. The criteria are very simple - the selection is 100%
subjective.*

### iOS development

[The first beta of Flutter is now released.](https://medium.com/flutter-io/announcing-flutter-beta-1-build-beautiful-native-apps-dc142aea74c0) It's Google's mobile UI framework that enables creating native interfaces for both iOS and Android with one codebase. I'm not a fan of cross-platform solutions, but this one looks interesting.

[iOS remote push notifications in a nutshell](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/ios-remote-push-notifications-in-a-nutshell-d05f5ccac252) - a nice tutorial explaining what are and how to use remote push notifications.

The most popular way of [rounding layers corners](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4754392/uiview-with-rounded-corners-and-drop-shadow) in iOS apps heavily taxes the performance. [This tutorial](http://texturegroup.org/docs/corner-rounding.html) shows you how to do this better.

### Security & Privacy

[F-Secure published a report showing sources and destinations of global cyber attacks in the second half of 2017\.](https://business.f-secure.com/infographic-threat-landscape-snapshot) Nice to know who hacks who. The main source of attacks is Russia and the main destination - United States.

Recently, the trend of more difficult access to jailbreaks has become more visible. Meanwhile, [a jailbreak source code for iOS 11](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/iOS-11.1.2-15B202-Jailbreak) has appeared on GitHub along with a [complete manual](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/iOS-11.1.2-15B202-Jailbreak/blob/master/iOS_jailbreak_writeup.pdf).

The last few months have not been kind to Apple when it comes to security. After problems with [macOS High Sierra admin privileges without a password](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/28/macos-high-sierra-bug-admin-access/), we've got another fail - [iPhone iBoot source code leaked on GitHub](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/07/iphone-source-code-github-leak/).

[Smashing magazine released a nice introduction to the General Data Protection Regulations for software developers.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/gdpr-for-web-developers/) The law, which will become effective in May across the European Union, will seriously affect how we manage user data in software products.

### Culture

[Steven Soderbergh's new film, Unsane, was entirely filmed using the iPhone](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-filmfestival-berlin-unsane/soderberghs-thriller-shot-on-iphone-premieres-in-berlin-idUSKCN1G52PR). Soderbergh says that in the process he noticed many positives and it will be difficult for him to return to the traditional way of making films.

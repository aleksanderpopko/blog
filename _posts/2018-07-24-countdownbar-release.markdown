description: A simple day-countdown menu bar app.
---
*TL;DR: I made a pretty simple day-countdown app for myself, now I’ve decided to release it in the App Store.*

The second quarter of 2018 was a crazy time for me. A hectic time at work, wedding preparations, and waiting for the honeymoon (the longest vacation I’ve had during the last two years). On the one hand, I was feeling crushed by too many deadlines, on the other - I was just counting down the days to pack a suitcase and go to Bali 🏝.

So, I looked through the day counters on the App Store but couldn’t find anything satisfactory. And that’s why I developed [CountdownBar](https://itunes.apple.com/app/countdownbar/id1413807534?mt=12) – my own pretty simple and minimalistic menu bar app. After coming back from my holidays, I’m still using it so, I decided to make it public.

Features:

* counts remaining days to a particular date
* possibility to choose an event that is visible on the menu bar
* possibility to add, remove, and edit your event
* optional launch on login

I made it 100% for myself, but as it is now public, I’m open to all suggestions and/or feature requests. I choose App Store as this the most secure form of distribution. I also decided it should be paid (0.99 USD). I don't expect to make a fortune, but I believe software should be paid in general💰.
